# Discrete Fourier transform of Guitar sounds and human voice
A DFT analysis of guitar notes and recorded human voice (talking and singing). Visualizing the frequency spectrum of audio signals that I recorded. I added ticks on the x-axis where the frequencies of the G Tone are (measured in Herz).

See /figs for the result and the ipynb for the code. /recs contains the audio recordings in m4a and mp3.
